# MindStrength Enterprise Amazon S3 Platform

---

## Project Overview

**MindStrength** is a Singapore-based mental wellness SaaS startup scaling rapidly across SE Asia. This project delivers a **production-grade Amazon S3 platform** designed to securely store, automate, monitor, optimize, and recover critical business data.

This platform addresses real-world challenges faced by MindStrength, including accidental data loss, compliance with Singapore PDPA, cost overruns, and operational inefficiencies.

## Use Case & Business Context

MindStrength manages diverse data types with varying sensitivity and access needs:

| Data Type               | Sensitivity | Access Team       | Volume    | Key Requirements                          |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| User Session Videos     | High        | Developers        | 50 GB     | Secure, versioned, lifecycle-managed     |
| Client Invoices & Contracts | Critical    | Finance           | 5 GB      | Encrypted, automated processing, audit  |
| HR Records             | Critical    | HR                | 2 GB      | Strict access, object lock, compliance   |
| Application Logs       | Medium      | Operations        | 100 GB/mo | Read-only access, lifecycle archiving    |
| Client Data Backups    | High        | Operations        | 80 GB     | Disaster recovery, replication           |
| Marketing Assets       | Low         | Marketing, Devs   | 15 GB     | Shared access, cost-optimized             |
| Deleted User Data (Archive) | Medium      | Legal/Operations  | 20 GB     | Object lock, long-term retention         |

## Project Objectives

- Design and implement multiple secure, versioned S3 buckets tailored to data sensitivity.
- Enforce least-privilege IAM roles and bucket policies.
- Automate workflows using Lambda, SNS, and SQS.
- Optimize storage costs with lifecycle rules and storage classes.
- Enable cross-region replication for disaster recovery.
- Monitor activity with CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Storage Lens.
- Document recovery procedures and cost optimization strategies.

## Key Features & Implementations

### Security

- **Versioning** enabled on all buckets to protect against accidental deletion.
- **Block Public Access** enforced globally.
- **Default Encryption** (AES-256) on all buckets.
- **Object Lock** enabled on legal archive bucket for compliance.
- **IAM Roles** with least privilege and folder-level access.
- **Bucket Policies** enforcing HTTPS-only and denying unencrypted uploads.
- **CloudTrail Data Events** enabled for audit logging.

### Automation

- **S3 Event Notifications** trigger Lambda, SNS, and SQS for invoice processing, virus scanning, and notifications.
- **Lambda Functions** automate metadata extraction and integration with internal systems.

### Cost Optimization

- Lifecycle rules transition data through Standard, Standard-IA, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and Deep Archive.
- Cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads.
- Intelligent tiering recommendations documented.

### Disaster Recovery

- Cross-region replication from Singapore (ap-southeast-1) to Sydney (ap-southeast-2).
- Documented recovery procedures for accidental deletion, ransomware, and compliance holds.

### Monitoring

- CloudWatch dashboards track storage growth, API calls, replication status, and security events.
- CloudTrail insights detect anomalous access patterns.
- Storage Lens and inventory reports provide detailed usage analytics.

## Disaster Recovery Playbook (Summary)

- **Accidental Deletion:** Use versioning to restore previous object versions within minutes.
- **Ransomware Attack:** Failover to replicated bucket in Sydney region.
- **Legal Compliance:** Object Lock prevents deletion of protected data.
- **Audit:** CloudTrail logs all access and changes for forensic analysis.

---

## Cost Optimization Summary

- Transition infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes.
- Delete incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days.
- Use lifecycle policies to automate data archiving.
- Monitor storage usage and costs regularly via CloudWatch and Storage Lens.
